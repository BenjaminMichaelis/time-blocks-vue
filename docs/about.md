# About This Component

## Purpose

This is a Vue 3 component designed to cater to unique scheduling and event management needs that other calendars may fall short of addressing. Born out of necessity, it offers a fresh perspective on usability and flexibility in event handling within applications.

## Inspiration

In the quest for the ideal event handling tool, many existing components were explored, including the notable [Qalendar](https://github.com/tomosterlund/qalendar) by Tom Osterlund. While Qalendar resonated with me due to its approach and functionality, there were some features left to be desired for my situation. My journey started from understanding and appreciating the capabilities and limitations of existing solutions, leading me to the creation of a more fitting and flexible calendar component to meet my needs.

Happy scheduling!
